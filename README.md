# My-Schedule
this is a project about my schedule
All your css style rules should be on an external style sheet
Your page MUST look PROFESSIONAL & POLISHED - a minimum of a "C" will be earned on pages that look incomplete, or unpolished (think about the Good Website / Bad Website assignment)
Consider what elements you need to include to make this page look like a page you thought was a good website. Ask yourself, if YOU landed on this page after a Google search, what would YOU think of the page's polish and professionalism.
Create a table that displays your course schedule – what class/times you are taking
There should be 5 columns, one for each day of the week
Create a header that spans across all 5 columns
Create a minimum of 4 additional rows *
Experiment with CSS Styling rules. http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_table.asp
A minimum of 3 different stylings should be applied to your table. Here are some ideas to look up.
width
border
padding
text‐align
border‐radius
border‐image:linear‐gradient
box shadow and/or text shadow
margin
Make sure your pages work (validate!!!) before you turn it in (both css & html). A MINIMUM of a "C"  will be earned if any page does not validate. (Warnings are ok). If you are unsure, ask me. For example: The validator will give an error if you incorporate google fonts. I would not dock you for that.  
* ALL steps below need to be done in order to have submitted this assignment. You WILL receive a ZERO if ALL of the following is not completed***
** All pages must validate or the assignment will earn a zero ****
Upload a zipped copy into Canvas
Create a file in your project called githublink.txt - and on that file past the link to your github account. Your repo should have a minimum of 3 commits
